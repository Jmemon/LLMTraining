def open_remote(url: str):
    """
    Provides protocol-agnostic access to remote data streams with consistent I/O semantics.
    
    Architecture:
        - Implements a thin adapter over smart_open with O(1) complexity for stream initialization
        - Abstracts protocol-specific connection details behind a uniform file-like interface
        - Maintains stateless operation with deferred resource allocation until actual I/O occurs
    
    Interface:
        - Parameters:
            url (str): Resource locator supporting multiple protocols (s3://, gs://, http://, file://)
                       Must be properly formatted according to protocol specifications
        - Returns:
            file-like: A context-managed stream object with standard file interface methods
                       (read(), readline(), __iter__(), etc.)
        - Exceptions:
            IOError: When resource cannot be accessed due to permissions or network issues
            ValueError: When URL format is invalid or protocol is unsupported
    
    Behavior:
        - Thread safety: Not thread-safe; each thread should maintain its own file handle
        - Resource lifecycle: Automatically manages connection pooling and resource cleanup
          when used as context manager (with open_remote(url) as f: ...)
        - Performance: Streams data with minimal memory footprint; does not load entire resource
    
    Integration:
        - Used by RemoteIterableDataset to access remote data sources
        - Example: 
          ```
          with open_remote("s3://bucket/file.txt") as f:
              for line in f:
                  process(line)
          ```
        - Dependency: Requires smart_open library with appropriate backend dependencies
          installed for each protocol (boto3 for S3, etc.)
    
    Limitations:
        - Text mode only: Opens files in text mode ('r'); for binary access modify implementation
        - Protocol support: Limited to protocols supported by smart_open
        - Error handling: Minimal error context; caller must handle protocol-specific errors
        - Buffering: Uses default smart_open buffering strategy; no custom buffer size control
