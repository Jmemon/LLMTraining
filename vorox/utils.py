def get_available_devices():
    """
    Discovers and returns all available PyTorch computation devices with O(n) complexity.
    
    Implements a device discovery mechanism that systematically identifies all accessible
    computation resources across heterogeneous hardware environments, prioritizing
    comprehensive detection over performance optimization.
    
    Architecture:
        - Implements sequential device detection with O(n) time complexity where n is device count
        - CPU detection: Constant-time operation with unconditional inclusion
        - CUDA detection: Linear-time enumeration of all NVIDIA GPUs via CUDA runtime API
        - MPS detection: Constant-time detection of Apple Silicon GPU via MPS backend
        - Memory complexity: O(n) for device list storage
        - Zero external dependencies beyond PyTorch's device management subsystem
        - Fail-safe design with graceful degradation when specialized hardware is unavailable
    
    Returns:
        list[torch.device]: Ordered list of available computation devices with the following properties:
            - Always includes CPU as the first element (guaranteed minimum length of 1)
            - Contains all detected CUDA devices with sequential indexing (cuda:0, cuda:1, etc.)
            - Includes MPS device if running on compatible Apple Silicon hardware
            - Device objects are fully initialized and ready for immediate use in tensor operations
            - Order is deterministic: CPU → CUDA devices (if any) → MPS (if available)
    
    Behavior:
        - Stateless operation with no side effects
        - Thread-safe due to absence of shared mutable state
        - Deterministic output for fixed hardware configuration
        - Zero caching strategy (performs fresh detection on each call)
        - Graceful handling of partial hardware availability
        - No exception propagation (hardware detection failures are suppressed)
    
    Integration:
        - Typically called during initialization phase of training/inference pipelines
        - Used for device selection, multi-GPU distribution, or fallback logic
        - Consumed by device placement strategies and distributed training coordinators
        - Example:
          ```
          devices = get_available_devices()
          device = devices[0] if len(devices) == 1 else devices[1]  # Prefer GPU if available
          model = model.to(device)
          ```
    
    Limitations:
        - No detection of specialized hardware beyond CUDA and MPS (TPUs, IPUs, etc.)
        - No capability assessment (only detects presence, not performance characteristics)
        - No memory availability checking (devices may be present but resource-constrained)
        - No support for remote or distributed devices
        - No prioritization based on device capabilities
        - Requires PyTorch with appropriate backend compilation (CUDA, MPS)
